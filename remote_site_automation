Create SSH key for user frappe
You are already logged in as the correct user:

whoami
→ frappe
Good.

🔐 Step 1: Generate SSH key (REQUIRED)
Run this exactly:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "erpnext-restore"
You will see prompts like this:

Enter file in which to save the key (/home/frappe/.ssh/id_ed25519):
👉 Press ENTER

Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
👉 Press ENTER

Enter same passphrase again:
👉 Press ENTER
This will create:
* /home/frappe/.ssh/id_ed25519 (private key)
* /home/frappe/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub (public key)

🔍 Step 2: Verify key exists

ls ~/.ssh
You should see:

id_ed25519
id_ed25519.pub
If yes → continue.

🔑 Step 3: Copy key to OLD server (one time)

ssh-copy-id frappe@38.54.61.106
